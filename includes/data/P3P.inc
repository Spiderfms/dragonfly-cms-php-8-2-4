Some types of data are inherently anonymous, such as randomly-generated session IDs. Data which might identify natural people in some circumstances, such as IP addresses, names, or addresses, must have a non-reversible transformation applied in order be considered "anonymized".',

This does not include personal information used to tailor or modify the content to the specific individual nor information used to evaluate, target, profile or contact the individual.',
	'TAI' => 'One-time Tailoring:<br />Information may be used to tailor or modify content or design of the site where the information is used only for a single visit to the site and not used for any kind of future customization. For example, an online store might suggest other items a visitor may wish to purchase based on the items he has already placed in his shopping basket.',

	'CON' => 'Contacting Visitors for Marketing of Services or Products:<br />Information may be used to contact the individual, through a communications channel other than voice telephone, for the promotion of a product or service. This includes notifying visitors about updates to the Web site. This does not include a direct reply to a question or comment or customer service for a single transaction -- in those cases, <current/> would be used. In addition, this does not include marketing via customized Web content or banner advertisements embedded in sites the user is visiting -- these cases would be covered by the TAI, PSA and PSD, or IVA and IVD purposes.',
	'HIS' => 'Historical Preservation:<br />Information may be archived or stored for the purpose of preserving social history as governed by an existing law or policy. This law or policy MUST be referenced in the <DISPUTES> element and MUST include a specific definition of the type of qualified researcher who can access the information, where this information will be stored and specifically how this collection advances the preservation of history.',

(e.g., the service provider and its printing bureau which prints address labels and does nothing further with the information.)',
	'DEL' => 'Delivery services possibly following different practices:<br />Legal entities performing delivery services  that may use data for purposes other than completion of the stated purpose. This should also be used for delivery services whose data practices are unknown.',
	'SAM' => 'Legal entities following our practices:<br />Legal entities who use the data on their own behalf under equable practices. (e.g., consider a service provider that grants the user access to collected personal information, and also provides it to a partner who uses it once but discards it. Since the recipient, who has otherwise similar practices, cannot grant the user access to information that it discarded, they are considered to have equable practices.)',
	'UNR' => 'Unrelated third parties:<br />Legal entities whose data usage practices are not known by the original service provider.',
	'PUB' => 'Public fora:<br />Public fora such as bulletin boards, public directories, or commercial CD-ROM directories.',

However, it is in the service provider\'s interest to ensure that the data is not used in a way that would be considered abusive to the users\' and its own interests.)',

	'NOR' => 'No Retention:<br />Information is not retained for more than a brief period of time necessary to make use of it during the course of a single online interaction. Information MUST be destroyed following this interaction and MUST NOT be logged, archived, or otherwise stored. This type of retention policy would apply, for example, to services that keep no Web server logs, set cookies only for use during a single session, or collect information to perform a search but do not keep logs of searches performed.',
	'STP' => 'For the stated purpose:<br />Information is retained to meet the stated purpose. This requires information to be discarded at the earliest time possible. Sites MUST have a retention policy that establishes a destruction time table. The retention policy MUST be included in or linked from the site\'s human-readable privacy policy.',
	'LEG' => 'As required by law or liability under applicable law:<br />Information is retained to meet a stated purpose, but the retention period is longer because of a legal requirement or liability. For example, a law may allow consumers to dispute transactions for a certain time period; therefore a business may for liability reasons decide to maintain records of transactions, or a law may affirmatively require a certain business to maintain records for auditing or other soundness purposes. Sites MUST have a retention policy that establishes a destruction time table. The retention policy MUST be included in or linked from the site\'s human-readable privacy policy.',
	'BUS' => 'Determined by service provider\'s business practice:<br />Information is retained under a service provider\'s stated business practices. Sites MUST have a retention policy that establishes a destruction time table. The retention policy MUST be included in or linked from the site\'s human-readable privacy policy.',
	'IND' => 'Indefinitely:<br />Information is retained for an indeterminate period of time. The absence of a retention policy would be reflected under this option. Where the recipient is a public fora, this is the appropriate retention policy.',
