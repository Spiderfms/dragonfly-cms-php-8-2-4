GPL Additional Notes

  Linking CPG Dragonfly™ CMS statically or dynamically with other modules is
  making a combined work based on CPG Dragonfly CMS.  Thus, the terms and
  conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

  As a special exception, the copyright holders of CPG Dragonfly CMS give you
  permission to link CPG Dragonfly CMS with independent modules that communicate
  with CPG Dragonfly CMS solely through the CPG Core interface, regardless of
  the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the
  resulting combined work under terms of your choice, provided that
  every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of
  the source code of CPG Dragonfly CMS (the version of CPG Dragonfly CMS used to
  produce the combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU
  General Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a module
  which is not derived from or based on CPG Dragonfly CMS.

  Note that people who make modified versions of CPG Dragonfly CMS are not
  obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
  their choice whether to do so.  The GNU General Public License gives
  permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
  exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
  carries forward this exception.
