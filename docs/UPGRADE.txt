To upgrade from PHP-Nuke 5.5-7.6, CPG-Nuke 8.x or 9.0.6.1

1. It is highly advised to do a full site back-up and database backup before
   upgrading on the slight possibility something may go wrong.

2. For security reasons, if the following file exists please delete it:
    - modules/Your_Account/admin.php

3. Keep a separate copy of the information in your old "config.php" - you will 
   need this information while upgrading through install.php.

4. Upload ALL the files of the 'html' directory to your website keeping
   the directory structure intact. (ex: admin->admin, modules->modules etc.)

5. Follow the steps in INSTALL.txt starting with step #3.

Notes:
======

A. If you are upgrading from a PHP-Nuke install it is advised you deactivate all
   blocks before upgrading. This may help avoid compatibility issues immediately
   after install and allow you to turn one block on at a time to see if it will
   work correctly under CPG Dragonfly CMS.

B. Some blocks will work as they are with CPG Dragonfly CMS but some will need 
   'porting' before they work properly. Please read
   http://dragonflycms.org/FAQ/index/id_cat=1.html for more information

C. Themes may also need some 'porting' before they will work properly, it is
   highly recommended you test your themes by changing it in your account before
   changing it to your default theme.  Ensure you update theme templates.

D. Please be sure to check the 'add-ons' folder for files you may need
   (downloads, weblinks, etc.) (more info about this in the INSTALL.txt file)

E. If you plan on using the attach-mod or other phpBB mods found on
   dragonflycms.org please look in the 'phpBB mods' folder.

F. More information about porting PHP-Nuke and other php applications is
