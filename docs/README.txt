  What is CPG Dragonfly CMS?

CPG Dragonfly CMS is a powerful, feature-rich advanced content management system
based on PHP-Nuke 6.5. We have spent nearly a year developing CPG Dragonfly CMS,
paying particular attention to security and stability. The release of
Dragonfly marks yet another milestone in our history.

Our software is written in PHP—the fastest programming language
spreading the net today—combined with your choice of either MySQL,
mysqli or PostgreSQL.

  Why CPG Dragonfly CMS?

Unlike other content management systems on the net, we maintain a high
standard of security, so that you spend time managing your site, instead
of it's software. We make managing your site easy with our line of
powerful tools, including a debugging system, BBCode support in many
site areas, a built-in photo gallery, and phpBB 2.0.x integrated.
