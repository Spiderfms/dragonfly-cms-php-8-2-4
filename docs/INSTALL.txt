In-depth installation instructions can be found on our website:
http://dragonflycms.org/Wiki/id=47.html


Base Requirements
-----------------

In order to setup CPG Dragonfly CMS, the following prerequisites are necessary:

- a web server (Apache prefered)
- PHP 4.1 or higher (4.3.x prefered)
- an SQL server (MySQL 4.x and PostgreSQL 7.3.x or later are supported)

Setup of these required packages is beyond the scope of this document and if
you are unsure you should check with each of the appropriate web sites for
further details.


Installing the Package
----------------------

If you are going to upgrade your website start at step two...
See http://dragonflycms.org/Wiki/id=40.html for info on starting a cvs site.

1) Create a new database, for example, 'dragonfly': mysqladmin create dragonfly
   OR add a database through your web control panel.

2) Upload all content from the /html directory to your webspace.

3) CHMOD the following file to 600 (622 if 600 fails):
   - cpg_error.log

4) CHMOD the following directories to 755 (777 if 755 fails):
   - cache
   - modules/coppermine/albums
   - modules/coppermine/albums/userpics
   - uploads/avatars
   - uploads/forums

5) In your web browser go to http://example.com/install.php
   The setup will install/update your database.

   After the database is created you will be prompted to insert additional
   information and, if it's a new install, to create the super user account.
   Create your super user following the on-screen instructions.

6) Login following the admin link (http://example.com/admin.php)

   Now click on "Main Settings" and change whatever you want to fit your site
   info. All the options you need to change are in the Settings menu.

7) After installing, delete install.php and the /install directory!


Testing the Installation
------------------------

Go to your homepage, for example:

    http://example.com/index.php
    
To login as administrator:

    http://example.com/admin.php
    
    This will give you full administrator privileges to your installation of
    CPG Dragonfly CMS.

    Remember to logout from admin after you use it. From this area you can
    delete or add content on your site, so never leave your computer without
    logging out from the admin account.

    We recommend the use of MySQL-Front or phpMyAdmin. Those are good
    administration systems for MySQL databases.
    dragonflycms.org/downloads/mysqlfront25.exe (free version)
    www.mysqlfront.de (30 days free)
    www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page

    We also recommend setting a password for your MySQL access. This is
    important as some data in the nuke database is not encrypted, so for
    security reasons you need to set a password. Not only that, it's a
    good practice!


Final Notes
-----------    

  That's it! You're done with CPG Dragonfly CMS. Just navigate around, play with it, 
abuse it and if you like CPG Dragonfly CMS, use it. Spend some time getting used to the 
administration interface.

  To change your site's logo, go to the /themes directory and make a custom
logo for each individual theme. Just navigate around all themes and change
the graphics you want.

PS: When you e-mail us asking something, just remember that we receive A LOT
of e-mails a day! We don't answer, but for sure we'll read it.
Your best bet is to visit the forums at dragonflycms.org/Forums.html and post
your questions there.
