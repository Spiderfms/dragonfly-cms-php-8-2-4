If you have SSH access to your webspace then it's easy to create a backup

Login to the server through SSH and browse to your public_html

For example:

    ls /home/MYNAME/public_html

Create a backup of your 'admin' directory to a compressed file:

    tar czvpf admin.tar.gz admin

This won't include "dotfiles" (the files or directories with names starting
with a dot). To tar everything:

   tar cvzf ../website.tgz  *  .[a-zA-Z]* *.[a-zA-Z]*

This will backup all of your files, but be aware that this file is publicly
available, so it's best to pack it somewhere else OR move (mv) the file

When you move the file outside public_html:

   mv website.tgz ../website.tgz

Or make the backup somewhere else like:

   tar cvzf /home/MYNAME/website.tgz  *  .[a-zA-Z]* *.[a-zA-Z]*


Of course you can also restore the backup by using the command:

   tar -xvzf website.tgz


Note: It doesn't matter if you use the file extension 'tar.gz' OR 'tgz'


Backup MySQL Database
---------------------

You can backup/restore your database easily through SSH

To create a backup:

   mysqldump -f -hlocalhost -u<USERNAME> -p<PASSWORD> <DBNAME> --add-drop-table
    | gzip -9c >/home/MYNAME/mysqlbackup.sql.gz

To restore the gzipped backup:

   gunzip < mysqlbackup.sql.gz | mysql -u<USERNAME> -p<PASSWORD> <DBNAME>

You can also restore a normal .sql file:

   mysql -u<USERNAME> -p<PASSWORD> <DBNAME> < mysqlbackup.sql

Don't forget to replace <USERNAME>, <PASSWORD> and <DBNAME> with your database
settings


No SSH Access
-------------

If you don't have SSH access it's no problem. Maybe you have luck and you can
run exec() or system() commands through PHP to accomplish above tasks

<?php
  exec('<command>');
?>

Of course replace <command> with one of the above mentioned commands and try to
run the script (in public_html, example: http://example.com/db_backup.php)
